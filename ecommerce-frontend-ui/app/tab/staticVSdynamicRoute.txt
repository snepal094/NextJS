static route 
a route that is predefined and does not change
less costly since data is fetched from nearby networks (geographically close locations)
saves bandwidth
fast loading
eg: pages with no change (login page)
Static routes are often used for content that doesn't change frequently and can be served from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

dynamic route
a route that is generated based on dynamic data or parameters
more costly since data is fetched from origin (generally far away)
eg: page after a user logs in (has to be user specific)
Dynamic routes often involve backend processing and database queries to generate the content on the fly.
